# DiamondPrice Prediction


# About
This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various attributes such as carat ,Depth,Table, x,y,z,cut,color,Clarity. The goal is to develop a machine learning model(Regression task) that can accurately estimate the price of a diamond given its characteristics.It used pipeline for automate prediction.

# RESULT
The assessment of diamond price prediction outcomes involves the analysis of diverse metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the R-squared score. These metrics serve as valuable indicators to gauge the efficacy of the model and its accuracy in forecasting diamond prices.
